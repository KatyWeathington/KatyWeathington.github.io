<p>I'm a fourth year PhD student at University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Information Science. My research aims to critically examine how data about queer and marginalized people is made and used. As a trans researcher, I often examine the ways trans and non-binary people are excluded from data structures and mishandled by algorithms.</p>

<h4> Dating Queerly: Queer Identities on Dating Apps</h4>
<p>As part of ongoing research, I have been critically analyzing dating apps, with a focus on how queer identities are transformed into data and utilized within the context of platform-facilitated profile recommendation.</p>
<!--<p> I performed a critical systems analysis of dating apps, both those with a primarily queer user base and those without, to see how queer identities are schematized, utilized, and calcified within the identity driven context of dating. We identified high level approaches to gender and sexuality and disentangle the several factors which cumulatively construct technical, functional versions of internally held highly personal identities.</p>-->

<h3>> Past Projects</h3>

<h4>Queerness in Wikidata</h4>
<p>This project examines how Wikidata, a database styled sister site to Wikipedia, handles queer identities. We examined the evolution of and discussions around the datafied representations of sexuality and gender identity. We pay special attention to the tensions that arose when trying to encapsulate the breadth of queer identities into a rigid database schema.</p>

<h4>Queer Individuals on Wikipedia</h4>
<p>This study follows our Wikidata project, and hopes to understand the representation and integration of queer individuals into the Wikipedia landscape as a whole. </p>

<h4>Critical Analysis of Crime Mapping Algorithms</h4>
<p>For this project, we studied two common crime mapping algorithms, KMeans and KDE, and their deployment. We critically analyzed the algorithm itself, as well as interviewing professionals and stakeholders use experience. This project culminated in my Master's thesis, which was defended in April of 2020.</p>
