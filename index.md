I'm a fifth year PhD candidate at University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Information Science. My research aims to critically examine how data about queer and marginalized people is made and used. As a trans researcher, I often examine the ways trans and non-binary people are excluded from data structures and mishandled by algorithms.
