# Reimagining Queer Dating Apps

Though dating apps offer users access to an abundance of potential partners, these apps often exclude people with LGBTQ identities and perpetuate cisgender, heterosexual norms. Therefore, as part of my dissertation, I undertook the project of reimagining dating apps to be "queerer" and center design values that are often overlooked in normative dating apps. Throughout this project, I with my colleagues collected data to guide ideation, synthesized answers to design challenges into cohesive designs, and prototyped these designs for final feedback.

# Going Queerer: Blue Sky Ideation 

Though the design above shifts the focus of dating apps and reduces reliance on normative gender and sexuality data, in many ways it still resembled the familiar structure of dating apps at its core. Therefore, I chose to continue a step further, and design alternatives that did not start from the perspective of redesigning a dating app, but rather, reimagining dating infrastructures.
